# Activity log

## 2026-10-15 — scaffold

- Created project skeleton under the `new-app` skill.
- Next: Phase 0 intake and tool-environment verification.

## 2026-10-15 — plan approved, loop prepared

- Owner approved PRD; private repo https://github.com/HarrisonFischberg/assist-ant created and pushed.
- Reviewed coleam00/ralph-loop-quickstart @ f6a7781 (no license file). Wrote original `ralph/ralph.sh` with the same contract: fresh `claude -p` per iteration, plus `/goal`, per-iteration `--max-budget-usd`, prd.md-based completion, stall stop.
- Verified `/goal` works headless: `claude -p '/goal The file ok.txt exists ...'` returned "The goal is met."
- Project `.claude/settings.json`: acceptEdits, sandbox on, network limited to npm + Playwright CDNs, xcodebuild/xcrun excluded from sandbox, push/gh/curl denied.
- Providers mocked until owner supplies test keys.

## 2026-10-15 — T001 visual direction (done)

- Picked the lowest pending task with no dependencies: T001.
- Ran `ui-ux-pro-max --design-system` (`~/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py`). It returned a landing-page pattern (hero + testimonials), which does not fit a toolbar popup. Used only its palette direction. Did not use its Inter font: system font stack instead, so no Google Fonts request and no new data flow.
- Wrote light and dark tokens in `replica/design/tokens.json` and component specs in `replica/design.md`.
- Ran the Replica contrast checker. First run: 6 failures, all from my token structure (nested `value` keys dropped by the checker), not contrast. Fixed by flattening to sibling tokens. Final run: 34 pairs, 0 failing AA.
- Files changed: `replica/design/tokens.json`, `replica/design.md`, `replica/contrast.txt`, `prd.md` (T001 status).
- Command: `python3 ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/replica-skill/replica-design/contrast.py replica/design/tokens.json`
- Output (trimmed, full copy in `replica/contrast.txt`):

```
  AAA   15.46:1  light-text-primary       on light-bg-canvas
  AA     5.32:1  light-text-muted         on light-bg-canvas
  AAA    7.10:1  light-accent-on          on light-accent
  PASS   3.43:1  light-border-control     on light-bg-surface     ui
  AA     6.10:1  dark-danger              on dark-bg-surface
  PASS   4.27:1  dark-border-control      on dark-bg-surface      ui
  34 pairs, 0 failing AA
```

- Next task: T002 (Xcode multiplatform Safari extension project). Depends on nothing; blocked on Apple Developer account only for device signing, not for simulator/macOS builds.

## 2026-10-15 — T002 Xcode extension project + esbuild pipeline (BLOCKED on verification)

- Goal turn: T002 is the lowest pending task with no dependencies.
- Built: `apple/AssistAnt.xcodeproj` generated with the `xcodeproj` gem (4 targets: app + Safari web extension for macOS and iOS; shared schemes `AssistAnt (macOS)` and `AssistAnt (iOS)`). Bundle IDs are placeholders (launch-blockers 11).
- Built: TypeScript sources `src/background.ts`, `src/popup.ts`, `src/popup.html`, `src/manifest.json`, `src/browser.d.ts`; `scripts/build.mjs` (esbuild IIFE bundle, target `safari16`, copies manifest and popup into `apple/Extension/Resources/`).
- Built: host app `apple/App/` (SwiftUI placeholder, macOS button opens Safari extension preferences). Extension `apple/Extension/SafariWebExtensionHandler.swift` (native messaging stub returns `ok`). Plists and entitlements (macOS app sandbox).
- Manifest permissions follow PRD: `activeTab`, `storage`, `scripting`, `nativeMessaging`, `contextMenus`. No host permissions.
- Dependencies: esbuild 0.28.2 (MIT), typescript 7.0.2 (Apache-2.0), recorded in `docs/asset-licenses.md`. No new data flow: `docs/data-inventory.md` unchanged (build-time tools, local native messaging stub).
- Safari API table: `docs/safari-api-support.md`. Source: MDN browser-compat-data 8.1.6 (CC0-1.0, read from npm into scratchpad). Apple's page returned title only, so Apple is not a source.

Commands and real output (trimmed):

```
$ npm run build
> node scripts/build.mjs
built extension to /Users/harrison/projects/assist-ant/apple/Extension/Resources
```

```
$ npx tsc -p tsconfig.json
(no output: typecheck clean)
```
(First run found 4 errors: `status` clashed with `window.status`, and the reply was untyped. Fixed in `src/popup.ts`.)

```
$ xcodebuild -list -project apple/AssistAnt.xcodeproj
Targets: AssistAnt (macOS), AssistAnt Extension (macOS), AssistAnt (iOS), AssistAnt Extension (iOS)
Schemes: AssistAnt (iOS), AssistAnt (macOS)
```

```
$ plutil -lint apple/App/Info.plist apple/Extension/Info.plist apple/App/AssistAnt.entitlements apple/Extension/AssistAntExtension.entitlements
apple/App/Info.plist: OK
apple/Extension/Info.plist: OK
apple/App/AssistAnt.entitlements: OK
apple/Extension/AssistAntExtension.entitlements: OK
```

```
$ xcodebuild -project apple/AssistAnt.xcodeproj -scheme "AssistAnt (macOS)" -destination generic/platform=macOS -derivedDataPath /tmp/claude-501/assistant-dd CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
Couldn't create workspace arena folder '/tmp/claude-501/assistant-dd': Unable to write to info file ... info.plist
NSUnderlyingError = "Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=1 \"Operation not permitted\"";
** BUILD FAILED **
```
Same EPERM with `-derivedDataPath` set to `build/DerivedData` (repo) and `/tmp/claude/assistant-dd`. Default DerivedData under `~/Library` also denied.

```
$ xcodebuild -scheme "AssistAnt (iOS)" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' build
xcodebuild: error: Unable to find a device matching the provided destination specifier:
  { platform:iOS Simulator, OS:latest, name:iPhone 17 }
```
Cause: no iOS Simulator runtime is registered; `simctl` reports CoreSimulatorService connection refused. The PRD destination cannot resolve here.

```
$ xcrun --sdk macosx swiftc -typecheck App/AssistAntApp.swift App/ContentView.swift Extension/SafariWebExtensionHandler.swift
error: unable to open output file '.../clang/ModuleCache/...SwiftShims...pcm': 'Operation not permitted'
```
Swift typecheck is also blocked by the sandbox (module cache and xcrun cache). Swift source NOT compiler-verified.

Acceptance status:
- Both targets build: NOT VERIFIED (sandbox EPERM, launch-blockers 9).
- Extension loads in Safari macOS and iOS Simulator: NOT VERIFIED (launch-blockers 10).
- API support table: DONE, documentation-based, flagged unverified at runtime.
- `npm run build`: PASS (output above).

Status: T002 set to `blocked`. Blockers 9, 10 recorded in `docs/launch-blockers.md`.

Next task: none runnable. T003 depends on T002 (blocked). Owner action needed: run `xcodebuild` builds outside the session sandbox (or approve a writable derived-data path) and load the extension in Safari macOS and iOS Simulator. Then set T002 to `done`.

Decisions taken (redirect if wrong):
- Used MDN BCD for Safari support data because Apple's page could not be read through the fetch tool.
- Kept `contextMenus` in the manifest per PRD, though MDN has no entry for it.
- Commit message author attribution: PROMPT.md names Claude Opus 5.5 as co-author; the session reminder says Haiku 5.5 is the current model. Used the PROMPT.md line (project instruction).
